Proposal for Project 1

Main Question: Are external factors (specifically population density, median income, gun sales, and unemployment rates) valid predictors of a state’s homicide rate/count? 

Objective: We will attempt to answer this question by analyzing the relationship between state’s homicide rates and the following factors:
Poverty Rates
Median Income
Median Home Value
Unemployment Rates

Sample Information: 
All 50 US States (possibly reduced to sample of 10-15 states depending on accessibility of every state’s homicide count)
Time Period: 2019

Data Sources: 
US Census Bureau for Median Income and Population Data
FBI API/CDC website (for homicide rates)
Bureau of Labor Statistics for unemployment date
Zillow for Median home value (Sept 2019)
