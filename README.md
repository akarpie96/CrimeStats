# Is Crime Predictable? 
Group Project: Crime Analysis 


Proposal: Analysis will examine whether there is relationship between violent crime (specifically homicide) and median income, unemployment rates, and gun ownership by state in 2019. We will do this by examining homicide data from the FBI API, median income data from the census bureau, and unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
